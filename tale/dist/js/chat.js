	    "phrase": "Now, we could just keep guessing here, but there's actually a helpful trick to neural networks, which helps us find the weights. It's called Gradient Descent.",

	},
	{
	    "phrase": "I think you got it, because she was off by exactly $$$! I think we should go on, because we've still got 69.990 more numbers to label.",

	    "second_answer": "What happened?!?"
	},
	{
	    "phrase": "I forgot that when we give Augusta more samples, the required weight changes. And the more samples we give, the bigger the possible range for the weight is. So now the slider goes all the way to 20. That makes it very hard to find the weight, when we have up to 30 million numbers to identify.",
	    "first_answer": "Then what do we do?",
	    "second_answer": "So, are we just giving up?"
	},
	{
	    "phrase": "Lucky for us, I can actually get Augusta to help us find the weight. If we teach her how gradient descent works, she can learn what the correct weight is¬†by herself. I'll upload a fix to you in a sec.",
	    "first_answer": "Go for it!",
	    "second_answer": "Neato."
	},
	{
	    "phrase": "Oh, I've just found 500 numbers lying around the old lady's place that were already sorted! I'll just send those over, so Augusta can use them to learn the weight.",

	    "second_answer": "500? Exactly? That's suspicious..."
	},
	{
	    "phrase": "With Augusta's new modifications, you should try feeding those numbers to her, and seeing if she learns how to find the proper weight. It might take a while, but I'm pretty sure she'll get there eventually. Just press the <i class=\"fa fa-graduation-cap\"></i> button to get started.",
	    "first_answer": "Good thing I'm very patient!",
	    "second_answer": "Fingers crossed!"
	},

	    "phrase": "Wow, that was a rousing success! üëè She found the weight, so now she can accurately identify all of those 500 numbers.",
	    "first_answer": "I think that would have taken me hours...",
	    "second_answer": "I guess that's pretty cool..."
	},
	{
	    "phrase": "Let's try giving her 50 new numbers that she's never seen and seeing if she's able to guess those right.",

	    "second_answer": "Just 50? So conservative! But ok."
	},
	{
	    "phrase": "Yeeeeeessssss! It worked! Looks like she got $almostAll correct! Out of those 50 numbers, her guesses were off by exactly $$$!",
	    "first_answer": "That was incredible!",
	    "second_answer": "Oh wow, I did not expect it to go that well."
	},
	{
	    "phrase": "That's pretty much all there is to neural networks actually.",
	    "first_answer": "That's it?",
	    "second_answer": "Does that mean I'm a neural network expert now?"
	},
	{
	    "phrase": "If we want to make Augusta even more accurate in the future when dealing with new numbers, we would need more identified data to train her.",

	    "second_answer": "*sigh*"
	},
	{
	    "phrase": "If we're fine with how she is doing now, we can just feed in some more of the numbers, and get Augusta's guesses. Just remember that the more data you want to handle, the more difficult it becomes to find the correct weight.",
	    "first_answer": "Don't worry, I'll be careful.",
	    "second_answer": "Yeah yeah, I get it. It's math."
	},
	{
	    "phrase": "I'll be leaving you alone now, but before I do, I wanted to share one final thing with you.",
