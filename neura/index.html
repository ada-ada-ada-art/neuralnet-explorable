			<h1>Neura<br>The World's Dumbest Dog<hr></h1>
			<p>So you wanna know how Neural Networks work, but you don't want all the math? You've come to the right place. First, I want you to meet Neura. She's the world's dumbest dog. Particularly, she's not very good at walking on a path. She follows a simple set of rules:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>She walks straight ahead.</li>
				<li>If she's off the path, she turns towards it.</li>
				<li>And forever and forever.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Try releasing her and see how that works out for her.</p>

			<h1>Intro to turning angles<hr></h1>
			<p>Right now, Neura is just using a specific angle to turn by. But if we want her to stay on the path as much as possible, we could try to help her by deciding her angle for her. You should try messing with that slider, and see if you can find the best angle for her.</p>

			<h1>Intro to self-training<hr></h1>
			<p>You know what would be great though? If Neura could train herself. That way, we would have time for all kinds of other things. The question: how do we do that?</p>
			<p>Well, since Neura is a very patient dog, we could release her for a walk, and tell her to slightly change the angle after each time.</p>
			<p>Try releasing her, and see how she does.</p>

			<h1>Getting more efficient at self-training<hr></h1>
			<p>Okay, well that was boring to watch. Maybe it works better, if we allow Neura a bit more freedom in teaching herself? Let's try working with how much she can change her turning angle. Try tweaking it, and let her loose!</p>

			<h1>Intro to training itself<hr></h1>
			<p>It seems Neura has definitely become quicker at improving herself, but she doesn't seem to know if it's better to increase or decrease the angle. We can help her by telling her how far away from the path she is, and then having her decide whether she is getting better or worse.</p>
